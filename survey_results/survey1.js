","To better understand what they are saying if its in the same language.","I mishear or miss words sometimes while watching so if I'm paying full attention, I don't want to have to rewind because I didn't catch something. ","I'm an English learner so it helps to have captions on as my reading skill is better than my listening skill.","I primarily use it when it's difficult to hear conversations. I also occasionally like to practice Spanish and will watch Spanish shows with English subtitles or vice versa.","If viewing in a language I don't speak, English captions help me understand the dialogue. If viewing in a language I do speak, it helps me make sure I understood the speaker correctly, especially if they are using unfamiliar terminology or speaking especially softly.","Easier understanding of the dialogue ","Easier to follow along","Just to make sure I don't miss out on important dialogues only because it was incomprehensible.","Sometimes I just cannot hear what people are saying if they are talking too fast, and I don't like to rewind scenes at all. So subtitles help. Or, if I'm watching a movie in another language, there are times when I don't know what they are saying, and subtitles help as well.","If not for a language I don't know, then its simply because I find it easier to keep track - sometimes the dialogues in a show can get missed if there's a lot of background noise or if they're discussing in accents I can't pick up quick enough ","Audio mixing for dramas (for some reason I haven't noticed it with comedies or cartoons) will tend to mix the voices to near-unlistenable levels unless you raise the volume, but that makes the rest of the show too loud. Captions are a decent workaround.","to keep up with what what is being said","It helps me to better hear the conversation that is going on. Such that instead of spending mental effort to try to comprehend what the user is saying, i can see it visually ","Making dialogue easier to understand (even in my native language)","","Usually when I watch an unfamiliar language movies/series, to get the authentic experience I prefer to watch with original audio rather than dubbed version. Hence, I do use subtitles !","I like to read the text while they talk. I guess it just became a habit after watching series in other languages","I am proficient in English, but having the captions on helps me understand accents, jokes, puns, etc. that I may not otherwise understand. For example, I watched just a few minutes of the Wheels of Time on Prime, and I decided I had no idea what they were talking about. There are no subtitles.

","Im not native english speaker, I watch all videos in english with subtitles in case I didnt get a word right","I sometimes have difficulty hearing dialogue over other sound effects that are played in the media.","It helps me understand better, at night I usually watch with lower volume so it makes up for the lack of sound.","It’s easier to comprehend what’s being said as sometimes speech isn’t as clear and I think I’m missing something being said","","It makes it easier to comprehend what they are saying when I hear it","I use captions because I most often watch TV after my kids go to sleep, and I have to keep the volume too low to fully understand the dialogue.","Sometimes the dialogue is hard to understand so it's easier to read it","To understand the dialogs as I watch shows with special vocabularies often","Because its easier to follow along ","I have trouble hearing the dialogue sometimes","","Hard to hear the audio often times.","If I am watching a movie in a completely foreign language, in order to understand the context I use the captions.","I cannot hear what people are saying sometimes.

I feel like I must be deaf or something!","My partner and I never enable captions, but both of my siblings always have captions enabled. I think this is because there is typically other noise at my parent's house since it's a household of 4 so it can be hard to hear the dialogue.
